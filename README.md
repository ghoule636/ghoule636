## About Me

My name is Gabriel Houle, a **Full-Stack Web Developer** (specializing in **Angular** Applications). I attended school at **University of Washington - Tacoma** and received my Bachelor in Computer Science & Systems in 2016.

I enjoy learning new systems and can get excited to dig into just about anything. I am currently excited to learn some UNIX systems programming. I am also working on writing an operating system from the boot-loader up.

Outside of software I am a volunteer rock climbing and backcountry ski instructor/leader with the Seattle Mountaineers club.
